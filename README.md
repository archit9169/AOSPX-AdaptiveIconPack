# AOSPX-AdaptiveIconPack
**Android Open Source Pixel Experience: Adaptive Icon Pack**

This is an alternative way to modify android apps icons which is system-wide and independent of launcher used.
It manually overrides each app resource and provide a seperate icon resource.

**For API 26+:** adaptive icons are to be provided assuming the app uses mipmap resource as launcher icon in their manifest. That is apps like whatsapp that use drawable resource as launcher icon will not be getting adaptive icon through this.

**For API 24:** Square Icons are to be provided. 

**For API 25:** Round Icons are to be provided.

All the resources used must be obtained from official sources and if obtained from third party sources, mention them in credits.
